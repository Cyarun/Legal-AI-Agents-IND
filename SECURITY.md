## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Legal AI Agents for India seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

Instead, please report them via email to: email@cynorsense.com

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours, we will acknowledge receipt of your report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days, we will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
- **Fix Timeline**: We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed about the progress of the fix
- **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will work with you on responsible disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys and Credentials**
   - Never commit API keys or credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use separate keys for development and production

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive legal documents at rest
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits

3. **Legal Document Handling**
   - Anonymize personally identifiable information (PII)
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Ensure compliance with data protection laws
   - Use secure file storage solutions

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   ```python
   # Bad: Hardcoded credentials
   api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
   
   # Good: Environment variables
   api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   # Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   def process_legal_query(query: str) -> str:
       # Sanitize input
       clean_query = sanitize_input(query)
       # Validate length
       if len(clean_query) > MAX_QUERY_LENGTH:
           raise ValueError("Query too long")
       return clean_query
   ```

3. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   ```python
   # Bad: String concatenation
   query = f"SELECT * FROM cases WHERE id = {case_id}"
   
   # Good: Parameterized queries
   query = "SELECT * FROM cases WHERE id = %s"
   cursor.execute(query, (case_id,))
   ```

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **API Key Authentication**: All API endpoints require valid API keys
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permissions
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Complete data separation between organizations
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted in storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation
- **Data Anonymization**: PII removal capabilities

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Regular security scanning of Docker images
- **Dependency Management**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules and network isolation
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting

## Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

### 1. Injection Attacks
**Risk**: SQL, NoSQL, Command injection
**Mitigation**: 
- Parameterized queries
- Input validation
- Least privilege database access

### 2. Authentication Issues
**Risk**: Weak authentication, session hijacking
**Mitigation**:
- Strong API key generation
- Session timeout
- Rate limiting

### 3. Data Exposure
**Risk**: Sensitive legal data leakage
**Mitigation**:
- Encryption
- Access controls
- Audit logging

### 4. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
**Risk**: Malicious script injection
**Mitigation**:
- Input sanitization
- Content Security Policy
- Output encoding
