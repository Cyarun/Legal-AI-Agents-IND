# Unstract Application - Findings Summary

## Application Status: âœ… WORKING

The Unstract application is functioning correctly. Issues reported are configuration-related, not bugs.

## Working Features

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- All Docker containers are running properly
- Web UI is accessible at http://docs.cynorsense.com:80
- Authentication system works (login/logout)
- Database, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO all operational
- Traefik reverse proxy routing traffic correctly

### âœ… Application Features
- User can login and navigate the application
- Workflow creation interface is accessible
- API deployment functionality exists
- Multi-tenant architecture is working

## Configuration Issues (Not Bugs)

### ðŸ”§ Google Drive Connector
**Issue**: Cannot connect to Google Drive
**Root Cause**: Missing OAuth2 credentials
**Solution Required**: 
```bash
# Add to backend environment:
GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY=your_client_id
GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
GOOGLE_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### ðŸ”§ Other External Connectors
**Issue**: Similar connection failures
**Root Cause**: Each connector requires specific credentials:
- Dropbox: Needs `DROPBOX_APP_KEY`, `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET`
- OneDrive: Needs `ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_ID`, `ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- AWS S3: Needs AWS credentials

**These are not application failures - they are expected behavior when credentials are not configured.**

## API Key Generation Process

### Current Implementation
1. API keys are **not** standalone entities
2. They are generated when deploying workflows as APIs
3. Process:
   - Create Workflow â†’ Deploy as API â†’ API Key Generated
   - Manage Keys option available after deployment

### Why This Design
- Security: Keys are tied to specific workflows
- Control: Organization-level access management
- Traceability: Each key linked to its purpose

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
1. **Local File Connectors**: Work without external credentials
2. **MinIO Storage**: Already configured and working
3. **Create Test Workflows**: Use local files to test functionality

### For External Connectors
1. **Google Drive**: Set up Google Cloud project and OAuth2
2. **Other Cloud Storage**: Configure respective credentials
3. **Document Requirements**: Each connector has specific needs

## Important Clarifications

1. **The application is NOT broken** - it's working as designed
2. **Connector errors are EXPECTED** without proper credentials
3. **API routing works** - both /api/v1 and /deployment paths
4. **No code fixes needed** - only configuration

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. **Configure OAuth Credentials**:
   - Create Google Cloud project
   - Enable Drive API
   - Generate OAuth2 credentials
   - Add to environment variables

2. **Test with Configured Connectors**:
   - Restart backend container after adding credentials
   - Test Google Drive connection
   - Verify file fetching works

3. **Deploy Sample Workflow**:
   - Create simple ETL workflow
   - Deploy as API
   - Test API key functionality

## Conclusion

Unstract is a well-architected, functional application. The reported issues are not bugs but expected behavior when external service credentials are not configured. The application follows security best practices by not including default credentials for external services.
