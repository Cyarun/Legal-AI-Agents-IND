# [FEATURE] Monitoring and Observability Stack

## 📋 Feature Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability using Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing with Jaeger/Tempo for all services.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection from all services
- [ ] Grafana dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Alert rules for critical issues
- [ ] Distributed tracing implementation
- [ ] Application performance monitoring
- [ ] Custom business metrics
- [ ] SLA/SLO tracking
- [ ] On-call rotation integration

## 🔗 Parent Epic
Epic: #EPIC-001 (Infrastructure Setup and Deployment)

## 📦 Dependencies
- Depends on: Services exposing metrics endpoints
- Blocks: Production readiness

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan
1. Add metrics endpoints to all services
2. Deploy Prometheus and configure scraping
3. Set up Grafana with dashboards
4. Implement distributed tracing
5. Create alert rules and notifications
6. Set up APM for performance tracking
7. Document monitoring practices

## ✅ Subtasks
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics to services:
