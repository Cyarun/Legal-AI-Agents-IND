# [FEATURE] Kubernetes Deployment Configuration

## 📋 Feature Description
Create Kubernetes deployment manifests for all services in the Legal AI system, including deployments, services, configmaps, secrets, and ingress configurations.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deployment manifests for all services (API, Graphiti, Neo4j, Redis)
- [ ] Service definitions with proper networking
- [ ] ConfigMaps for environment variables
- [ ] Secret management for sensitive data
- [ ] Ingress configuration with SSL/TLS
- [ ] Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) configs
- [ ] Resource limits and requests defined
- [ ] Health checks and readiness probes

## 🔗 Parent Epic
Epic: #EPIC-001 (Infrastructure Setup and Deployment)

## 📦 Dependencies
- Depends on: Docker images being available
- Blocks: Production deployment

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan
1. Create namespace and RBAC configurations
2. Write deployment manifests for each service
3. Configure services and networking
4. Set up ConfigMaps and Secrets
5. Configure Ingress with cert-manager
6. Add HPA and resource management
7. Test in minikube/kind
8. Document deployment process

## ✅ Subtasks
- [ ] Create `k8s/` directory structure
- [ ] Write namespace.yaml
- [ ] Create deployment manifests:
  - [ ] unified-api-deployment.yaml
  - [ ] neo4j-statefulset.yaml
  - [ ] redis-deployment.yaml
  - [ ] graphiti-deployment.yaml
- [ ] Create service definitions
- [ ] Write ConfigMap templates
- [ ] Set up Secret management
- [ ] Configure Ingress rules
- [ ] Add HPA configurations
- [ ] Create Helm chart (optional)
- [ ] Write deployment documentation
- [ ] Test full deployment

## 📊 Estimation
- Complexity: `L`
- Estimated Hours: 16-20

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- Deploy to local Kubernetes (minikube/kind)
- Test service discovery
- Verify persistent volumes
- Load testing with HPA
- SSL/TLS verification
