# [FEATURE] GraphQL API Implementation

## 📋 Feature Description
Implement a GraphQL endpoint alongside the existing REST API to provide flexible querying capabilities for complex legal data relationships.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GraphQL schema defined for all entities
- [ ] Query operations for all major endpoints
- [ ] Mutation operations for data modifications
- [ ] Subscription support for real-time updates
- [ ] GraphQL playground enabled in development
- [ ] Authentication integration
- [ ] Rate limiting per query complexity
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## 🔗 Parent Epic
Epic: #EPIC-002 (Unified API Enhancements)

## 📦 Dependencies
- Depends on: REST API being stable
- Blocks: Frontend dashboard (can use GraphQL)

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan
1. Add GraphQL dependencies (strawberry-graphql)
2. Define GraphQL schema
3. Create resolvers for queries
4. Implement mutations
5. Add subscriptions with WebSocket
6. Integrate authentication
7. Add query complexity analysis
8. Write comprehensive tests

## ✅ Subtasks
- [ ] Add GraphQL dependencies to pyproject.toml
- [ ] Create `app/graphql/` directory structure
- [ ] Define schema:
  - [ ] Legal entity types
  - [ ] Query type definitions
  - [ ] Mutation type definitions
  - [ ] Subscription types
- [ ] Implement resolvers:
  - [ ] Crawl operations
  - [ ] Graph search operations
  - [ ] Document processing
  - [ ] Legal analysis
- [ ] Add GraphQL endpoint to main.py
- [ ] Implement DataLoader for N+1 prevention
- [ ] Add query complexity limiting
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Create GraphQL documentation
- [ ] Add example queries

## 📊 Estimation
- Complexity: `XL`
- Estimated Hours: 32-40

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all resolvers
- Integration tests for complex queries
- Performance tests for query optimization
- Security tests for query depth attacks
- Load tests with concurrent queries

## 📝 Documentation Updates
- [ ] GraphQL schema documentation
- [ ] Query examples guide
- [ ] Migration guide from REST
- [ ] Performance best practices
