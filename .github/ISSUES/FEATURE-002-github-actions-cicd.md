# [FEATURE] GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

## 📋 Feature Description
Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment of all services.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated testing on pull requests
- [ ] Docker image building and pushing
- [ ] Semantic versioning and releases
- [ ] Deployment to staging/production
- [ ] Security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- [ ] Code quality checks
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Notification system for failures

## 🔗 Parent Epic
Epic: #EPIC-001 (Infrastructure Setup and Deployment)

## 📦 Dependencies
- Depends on: Repository structure
- Blocks: Automated deployments

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan
1. Set up workflow directory structure
2. Create PR validation workflow
3. Build and push Docker images workflow
4. Release management workflow
5. Deployment workflows (staging/prod)
6. Security scanning integration
7. Documentation generation
8. Set up secrets and environments

## ✅ Subtasks
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/` structure
- [ ] Write PR validation workflow:
  - [ ] Python linting (ruff, black)
  - [ ] Unit tests
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] Coverage reports
- [ ] Docker build workflow:
  - [ ] Multi-arch builds
  - [ ] Image scanning
  - [ ] Push to registry
- [ ] Release workflow:
  - [ ] Semantic versioning
  - [ ] Changelog generation
  - [ ] GitHub releases
- [ ] Deployment workflows:
  - [ ] Staging deployment
  - [ ] Production deployment
  - [ ] Rollback mechanism
- [ ] Security workflows:
  - [ ] Dependency scanning
  - [ ] Code security analysis
  - [ ] Container scanning
- [ ] Documentation workflow
- [ ] Notification setup (Slack/Email)

## 📊 Estimation
- Complexity: `L`
- Estimated Hours: 20-24

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
